# Image Classification: Simpsons Chracter Recognition
Group member: Yanan Gao, Yu Zhu
## How the project is organized
* _Data cleaning and processing.ipynb_ : Contains data loading, cleaning and processing. After this step, the data is ready to be fitted into various models.
* _k-NN model.ipynb_ : Contains the implementation of k-NN model, including cross validation, model fitting, accuracy calculating and visulization (cv score plot).
* _Random forest model.ipynb_ : Contains the implementation of random forest model, including model fitting, accuracy calculating and visulization (confusion matrix).
* _SVM with RBF kernel model.ipynb_ : Contains the implementation of SVM with RBF kernel model, including cross validation, model fitting, accuracy calculating and visulization (confusion matrix).
* _CNN models.ipynb_ : Contains the implementation of CNN model, including two different models (first one without data augmentation, second one with augmentation), visulization (history accuracy and loss plots).
